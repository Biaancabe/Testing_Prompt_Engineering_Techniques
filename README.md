# Evaluation of Prompt Engineering Techniques
This folder is designed to evaluate the performance of a LLM in generating a list of medications by comparing it with a benchmark list of medications

It has a separate subfolder for each disease in which a script has been written for each prompt engineering technique. 
These contain the list of drugs generated by LLM and a list of the benchmark drugs. The script checks which drugs from the LLM-generated list are also in the benchmark and outputs them
